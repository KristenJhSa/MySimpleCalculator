This is a simple calculator I built using Python.
It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

This is one of my very first projects, and I'm excited to keep learning and sharing more!

âœ¨ Skills I practiced:

Writing functions

Using user input

Basic Git and GitHub

Thanks for checking it out! ðŸš€
